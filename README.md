# Angular Viz

This sample AngularJS project illustrates the various real-time data visualization using d3.js and c3.js.

[Live](https://angular-viz.herokuapp.com/)

## Motivation

My last public AngularJS and NodeJS project doesn't reflect my current skills in the respective tech stack. I always wanted to publish my directory structure, design pattern and various tricks and trades that I learn for others to see. This project will be a playground for me to put them online for others to learn.

__I will also write a blog post in near/far future__

## Blog Posts

* __None so far__ :(

## Current Status

* The project is in its infant stage.
* `<line-chart>` directive implemented, but tests to be written in near future.

```
<line-chart line-id="chart1", real-time="y"><line-chart>
```

## Pipeline

* Directory structure for NodeJS - to correct.
* Make `<line-chart>` more customizable.
* Other viz charts - pie chart, histogram and many other.
* Write Tests.

## Build

`npm install`
`gulp start`
